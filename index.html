	  <p> The Agile Manifesto </p>
	   <p> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
	  </p>
	  <ul> 
		<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
		<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
		<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
		<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
	</ul>
	<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. </p>
